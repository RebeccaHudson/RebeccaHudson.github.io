<p> Catching up on our current situation:</p>
<h2>ROSE:</h2>
<h3>Rooseville to Eureka!</h3>
<p>
An early rise for a 10 mile trek up hwy 93 to Whitefish Bike retreat for our shuttle up to Rooseville, MT at the Canadian boarder. We ended up giving our shuttle driver, James, a van conversation to add to his top five strangest conversations he’s everhad; you’ll have to catch a ride with him to find out what it was about. 
A few hours of putting racks back on, finishing a few beers, and getting gear situated before a leisurely ride to Eureka MT.
</p>

<p>
Eureka, MT has a cute space next to the creek for camping right in town, though the bathrooms are at the 24 hr gas station across the street AND beware the 0700 sprinkler system. The historical site has a nice pavilion with water and electricity near the city “wild walk” along the creek, don’t try to camp in the pavilion…also beware of the skunk.

<h3>Eureka, MT to Whitefish, MT</h3>

<p>
About 20 miles from Eureka to Clarence Creek campground, a simple mountain two site camping area near a beautiful small creek with ice cold delicious (filtered) water.  We are still getting organized and filtering through what we really need/want at this point (Rebecca and Patrick already mailed a few things back home in Whitefish—I feel I’ll be doing the same once back in Whitefish).
</p>

<p>
About 12 miles from Clarence Creek to Tuchuck campground. 
This was and adventure within one for sure.  I(R ose) had a non-repairable side wall blowout on my rear wheel about 3 miles from Tuchack campground. Rebecca and Patrick returned to my rescue after about a mile of hike-biking. Upon our arrival to Tuchuck we met Doug who immediately offered tools, supplies and a ride the next day. After some discussion and planning we (Rose and Patrick) had arranged a ride back to Whitefish with Doug; Rebecca and Vlad planned on carrying on following the route back to Whitefish.
</p>


<h4>The Rose &#38; Patrick show:</h4>

<p>
The ride with Doug was wonderful.  He is local Montanan with a heart of gold and a wonderful knowledge of the area we were in. Patirick and I both felt like we got a tour of the area with history and defining land formations identified.  We ended up taking most of the route we would have riden via truck; Red Meadow lake is beautiful and I wish we could have stayed there for the night.  We rolled into Whitefish about 4.5 hours after pickup from Doug and he so kindly brought us to the bike shops (all closed for Sunday) and an outdoor store looking for a new tire, with no luck on that front.
</p>


<p>
The next day Patrick was able to take my wheel and get a new tire (as well as a spare that would fit all out wheels) from Glacier Cyclery &#38; Nordic! Thank you all at that location, you ended up helping us out three separate times!!  
Vlad and Rebecca rolled into camp this evening. 
</p>

<p>
Tuesday, JUNE 29th-(WONDER WOMAN)- EMILY ARRIVES!!!! YAY!!  
In an attempt to surprise Emily, Patrick and I rolled into Whitefish early and got coffee and toast (and free makeup samples cause they were out if a second slice of sourdough?!?!?) The train was 2 hours late....
Breakfast with all five of us in Whitefish!  A rest and bike mechanic stuff day...Riding again tomorrow.

<h3>Vlad thoughts: </h3>
<p>
I'm finally in Montanta, USA! Some of our readers are perhaps aware of Montana, Bulgaria, which I guess I should visit next to compare. For the record, North Dakota is very flat, whereas Montana is hilly, mountainous, and dry (the dry heat is quite reminiscent of Bulgarian summers I grew up with). 
</p>

<p>
After the two day drive to Whitefish (June 21 and 22), we noticed my front disc break seemed to whistle, so the following rest day (June 23), I left Duncan at Glacier Cyclery for adjustments (which would not be the last time); also from Glacier Cyclery I procured the all-important fanny pack for Rebecca, and a strap for the speaker Rose &#38; Patrick lent me (music regulates the pedal cadence, especially uphill).
Notably, Whitefish is home to Proof Research, a corporation developing carbon-fiber barrels and rifles, a far cry from the pure math research I assumed they'd be doing.
</p>

<p>
The following day (Thursday, June 24) we set off (way early, trying to leave by 7am) on our bikes toward the Whitefish Bike resort, wherein we had some local ice-cream to prepare us.
Next, we were shuttled to Roosville, MT, around 1,000 feet from the U.S.-Canadian border (on the U.S. side), and after some adjustments and repacking (Rebecca and I had to dismantle the front racks off Loreli and Duncan in order to fit them on the shuttle's bike bracket), we finally began riding the Great Divide Mountain Bike Route! 
There was a spittle of rain that prompted me to don my rain jacket for a while, but otherwise we had smooth mostly flat and downhill ride punctuated with a few climbs and quite the breathtaking views (Montana is Big Sky country after all). 
We finished what we consider Day 0's riding at Eureka, MT (we found it!).
Therein Rebecca and I had local pizza for dinner, then attempted and promptly aborted a journey along the riverwalk due to an overabundance of mosquitoes. Note: the sun sets after 9:30pm here and it is light quite past 10pm, so twilight is much later than usual.
</p>

<p>
June 25, Day 1 of riding, was begun with a massive breakfast at the local Cafe Jax, followed by a short steep ascent, continued with an uneventful, chiefly downhill ride on paved roads for the first half of the day, then a not too difficult uphill to our first proper (i.e. away from people and amenities) campsite at Clarence Creek. 
Day 2 of riding took us down, and then up to our first crossing of the continental divide -- Whitefish Divide. 
The climb was hard: steep over a dirt road littered with rocks, quite a lot of which I had to push rather than ride Duncan over, but eventually we made it, and at the very top there was even snow! 
Note: we're doing this in an unprecedented heat wave with temperatures in the 90s (Fahreneheit), but fortunately the virtually inexistent humidity, the tree cover, our downhill velocity, cooling arm-sleeves (bonus UV protection!) and coming from Madison's near 100% humidity made the high temperatures actually pleasant (though our carrying gallons of water was indeed justified).
Post-Divide we descended to Tuchuck, but did not all of us continue to Red Meadow as planned due to Rose's sidewall blowout (treacherous sharp rocks!)
</p>

<h4>The Rebecca and Vlad show:</h4>

<p>
The RV team rides from Tuchuck to Red Meadow Lake. We encounter hot conditions, and a steep climb up to Red Meadow pass (more bike pushing from V), punctuated by our first black bear sighting (it ran away; that's why we blare music as we ride: to ensrure bear awareness of us: don't want to startle a sleeping bear!).
</p>
<p>
At Red Meadow lake, Rebecca and Vlad camp at the free National Forest campground, get chased around by bugs (from mosquitos really, the bees did not bite), and have a 4:00pm takeoff the following afternoon after Rebecca installs front brake pads and re-adjusts the front rack on Loreli. 
We then descend steeply and terrifyingly until Rebecaa's front rack jostles loose (faulty bolt) and Vladimir's back break seems to fail. 
</p>
<p>
We then spent an hour and a half replacing the break pad with a sturdy one, and continue a very speedy descend until we reach the forest road. We see another black bear, then go somewhat fast on the forest road, which is for a while a gravel road with lots of fun ups and downs, requiring very careful and focused riding, but we make it finally to the paved road around Whitefish lake, which we follow succesfully and without incident to the campground at Whitefish, thereby completing a loop and rejoining our friends.
</p>
<p>
The following day, June 29th, is a rest day, during which I (Vlad) once again deposit Duncan with Glacier Cyclery to double-check my rear-break work and fix the housing of my front break cable. More replacement break pads are procured, and amazing crepes are had.

Here are some out-of-order rough notes I am leaving in as this entry is being formatted, that I think are illuminating with regards to the thought process and style of consciousness that characterizes the trip, as well as this blog.

<h3>Swan River to HWY 83/Seeley Lake   AND Swan River to Clearwater Lake</h3>
<h4>A.  Rose and Patrick</h4>
<p>
     Well.....we had a ride arranged for noon then the lady came by and the truck she was going to use was not available anymore.  Not even a half hour later we had a local gentleman stop and offer assitance and "someone will be back in half hout to hour"- 45 Minutes later Ally, her elderly Mom, and Lily- the 4 month old pug rolled up to give us a ride to Seeley Lake, MT.  About 45 minutes later we rolled into Big Larch Campground and eventually found the bicycle camping.  Thank you trail angels that have helped us out so far!! We keep you all in our hearts and can only hope to someday pay it forward!
</p>

<h4>B. Emily Rebecca Vlad</h4>
<p>
We set off in the cool of the morning for Clearwater lake where Patrick said there were great views and camping along the lake. Early in the day's ride, a highly annuated man with red hat on an E Fat Bike crossed paths with us and explained that he should head home for the day, so he turned around and followed us frmo explained that Sycamore Tree is not an actual tree but is a Catholic resort.  
    <ul>
    <li>goat yelling 'DEATH'...</li>
    <li>climbed past holland lake, very busy. Many boat folks. 2 identical white Prisuses formed a mini traffic jam on a dirt forest road..</li>
    <li>Dirt road with  bear tracks</li>
    <li>Tiny singletrack felt like we were totally lost.</li>
    <li>had to portage bicycles over a downed tree, only to reload and portage over what our directions
    apparently described as 'ascend up a steep hill' and should have described as 'push bike up barely
    passable not-quite-even-singletrack' which had us worried we were lost unitl we came upon the next
    direction onto a forest road.</li>
    <li>My rear brake completely failed almost exactly at the clearwater lake trailhead, and I had to hike down a steep hiking path fully loaded with one working break...</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h3>Camp + Rest Day at clearwater lake.</h3>
<p>Long hike down; only visible campsite occupied by family. When approached, they let us know that other campsites were available on the hiking trail along the lake shore.  Very soon after setting up camp, I(R) waded naked into Clearwater lake up to my ribcage, and in short order caught and released two very small fish.
 </p>

 <h4>rest day:<h4>
 <ul>
	 <li>solo stove bread success (the breakthrough)  VLAD.</li>
	 <li> Rebecca changed break pads on rear of Loreli and and readjusts rear brake</li>
		 <li>Finally re-leveled my front rack, which had been off kilter since the descent from Red Meadow Lake, replaced the defective lock nut on the front rack and added missing washers and threalocker... and re-wrapped my bar tape so it doesnt's straigh up fall off as I ride.</li>
		 <li>that evening we hiked 80% of our gear up to the parking lot at clearwater (a steep and at least 1/2 mile walk). </li>
 </ul>

 <h3>  Biking DAY!! to seeley lake.</h3>
 <p> We got up at 530AM, packed tents and sleeping gear, and hiked up to the top. We ate breakfast and were on our way by 8. </p>
 <ul>
	 <li>    climbed up the pass and rebecca's rear brake failed again because I didn't tension the bolt holding 
		 the cable enough.</li>
	 <li> Singletrack at the top with tall grass on both sides. </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
 We traverse the SLIDE ZONE, described on our official maps as a place to exercise great caution as the trail has failed there before previously. In a few instances, wrecking one of our bicycles would have entailed a drop off of a steep cliff and essentially instant death or serious injury. At the end of the nerve-wracking single track, where the forest road picked up, we had a pre-prepared container lunch.</p>
 <p>
 <ul>
	 <li>   MTB Descent into seeley.
		 Early on in the descent, friendly people riding up the grade apporach (rebecca and louie), flag us down for a moment,  and say that rose and 'Scott' pat are at a place called "Big Larch". </li>
	 <li>We roll into Big Larch National Forest Campground.</li>
	 <li>So its... Vacation from vacation. in seeley lake and getting comfortable for a minute.</li>
	 <li>Ovando incident!!! OMG. (external link)</li>
	 <li>the librarian Susan is friendly, lends out Travels With Charlie by Steinbek for Patrick on my honor.</li>
	 <li>so, no missolua spur, but 2 drops in Seeley Lake anyway, WTF.</li>
	 <li>A common occurance at the Big Larch campground is spotting a black bear on the beach, within eyeshot of our bicycle campsites in the morning or evening.</li>
	 <li>Fat Hippie in Seeley Lake is a cool headshop, they are among the most prominent retailers in town.</li>

	 <li>Austin and Frida show up to transport Emily and Cyclesauraus home!  Bike tour style margaritas make the night special!!</li>
	 <li> When I(R) went to fish just out of town, I encountered a mennonite farmers market in the Baptist church parking lot.</li>
	 <li>Rebecca loses sunglassses, likely stolen by a raven, which we know have a special interest in shiny objects.</li>
	 <li>Doing laundry, visiting Gus, the biggest larch in North America, and looped the lake with Rosie.</li>
	 <li>The bear that killed the lady in Ovando was found and shot.</li>
