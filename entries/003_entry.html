Entry 2:
Live from Seeley Lake MT!

Catching up on our current situation:

ROSE:
Rooseville to Whitefish, MT

Rooseville to Eureka!

An early rise for a 10 mile trek up hwy 93 to Whitefish Bike retreat for our shuttle up to Rooseville, MT at the Canadian boarder. We ended up giving our shuttle driver, James, a van conversation to add to his top five strangest conversations he’s everhad; you’ll have to catch a ride with him to find out what it was about. 
A few hours of putting racks back on, finishing a few beers, and getting gear situated before a leisurely ride to Eureka MT.

Eureka, MT has a cute space next to the creek for camping right in town, though the bathrooms are at the 24 he gas station across the street AND beware the 0700 sprinkler system. The historical site has a nice pavilion with water and electricity near the city “wild walk” along the creek, don’t try to camp in the pavilion…also beware of the skunk.

Eureka, MT to Whitefish, MT

About 20 miles from Eureka to Clarence Creek campground, a simple mountain two site camping area near a beautiful small creek with ice cold delicious (filtered) water.  We are still getting organized and filtering through what we really need/want at this point (Rebecca and Patrick already mailed a few things back home in Whitefish—I feel I’ll be doing the same once back in Whitefish).

About 12 miles from Clarence Creek to Tuchuck campground. 
This was and adventure within one for sure.  I(R ose) had a non-repairable side wall blowout on my rear wheel about 3 miles from Tuchack campground. Rebecca and Patrick returned to my rescue after about a mile of hike-biking. Upon our arrival to Tuchuck we met Doug who immediately offered tools, supplies and a ride the next day. After some discussion and planning we (Rose and Patrick) had arranged a ride back to Whitefish with Doug; Rebecca and Vlad planned on carrying on following the route back to Whitefish.

The Rose & Patrick show:

The ride with Doug was wonderful.  He is local Montanan with a heart of gold and a wonderful knowledge of the area we were in. Patirick and I both felt like we got a tour of the area with history and defining land formations identified.  We ended up taking most of the route we would have riden via truck; Red Meadow lake is beautiful and I wish we could have stayed there for the night.  We rolled into Whitefish about 4.5 hours after pickup from Doug and he so kindly brought us to the bike shops (all closed for Sunday) and an outdoor store looking for a new tire, with no luck on that front.

The next day Patrick was able to take my wheel and get a new tire (as well as a spare that would fit all out wheels) from Glacier Cyclery &#38; Nordic! Thank you all at that location, you ended up helping us out three separate times!!  
Vlad and Rebecca rolled into camp this evening. 

Tuesday, JUNE 29th-(WONDER WOMAN)- EMILY ARRIVES!!!! YAY!!  
In an attempt to surprise Emily, Patrick and I rolled into Whitefish early and got coffee and toast (and free makeup samples cause they were out if a second slice of sourdough?!?!?) The train was 2 hours late....
Breakfast with all five of us in Whitefish!  A rest and bike mechanic stuff day...Riding again tomorrow.

The Rebecca and Vlad show:

The Rv team ride from Tuchuck to Red Meadow Lake. We encounter hot conditions, and a steep climb up to Red Meadow pass, punctuated by our first black bear sighting.

At Red Meadow lake, Rebecca and Vlad camp at the free National Forest campground, get chased around by bugs, and have a 4:00pm takeoff the following afternoon after Rebecca installs front brake pads and re-adjusts the front rack on the bicycle.

Not even a half hour later we had a local gentleman stop and offer assitance and "someone will be back in half hout to hour"- 45 Minutes later Ally, her elderly Mom, and Lily- the 4 month old pug rolled up to give us a ride to Seeley Lake, MT.  About 45 minutes later we rolled into Big Larch Campground and eventually found the bicycle camping.  Thank you trail angels that have helped us out so far!! We keep you all in our hearts and can only hope to someday pay it forward!

  B. Emily Rebecca Vlad

    goat yelling 'DEATH'...

    climbed past holland lake

    Dirt road with  bear tracks
    Tiny singletrack felt like we were totally lost.
    had to portage bicycles over a downed tree, only to reload and portage over what our directions
    apparently described as 'ascend up a steep hill' and should have described as 'push bike up barely
    passable not-quite-even-singletrack' which had us worried we were lost unitl we came upon the next
    direction onto a forest road.

    Rebecca's rear brake completely failed almost exactly at the clearwater lake trailhead, and I
    had to hike down a steep hiking path fully loaded with one working break....


    Camp + Rest Day at clearwater lake.
       long hike down; only visible campsite occupied by family.
       naked fishing success!!

       finally re-level my front rack; replace defective lock nut on front rack and added missing 
       washers and threalocker. And re-wrapped my bar tape so it doesnt's straigh up fall off as I ride.
       that evening we hiked 80% of our gear up to the parking lot at clearwater (a steep and at least
       1/2 mile walk).

    Biking DAY!! to seeley lake.
      we got up at 530 and hiked up to the top; had breakfast and were on our way by 8. 
      climbed up the pass and rebecca's rear brake failed again because I didn't tension the bolt holding 
      the cable enough.
