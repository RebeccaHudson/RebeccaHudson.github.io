<h3>Entry 4: Cow Interlude</h3>
<p>
Vladimir here, reporting on a herd of cows that walked, in just before we headed out, right where we had camped! If we'd slept in another hour we would have been overrun with cows! This was on the last day of July; this post a testing of my ability to blog from my phone; enjoy!
