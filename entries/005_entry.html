<h3>9/13/2021 First Day out of Lima:</h3>
<p>
Our five food boxes finally arrived and we gradually put ourselves together.
Just as we were getting ready to leave, just finishing strapping on stuff to bikes, a large storm front moved in from the mountians and kicked up an incredibly
strong wind, strong enough to create small blinding dust-devils, that drove us all over to the I-25 rest stop to hide in the rest stop and on the downwind side of the building to collect ourselves. After much deliberation, we decided that another night in Lima was not worth it.

<p>
We rolled out of town, immediately hitting a dirt road. We ended up camping within view of Lima Dam on BLM land down a steep slope.

	<h3>Lima Dam to Red Rock Lake Campground</h3>
	<p>
In the morning at the Dam, wihle preparing to filter water, Rose spotted a duck stuck headfirst into the rocks near the dam, kicking its feet weakly. She rescued the duck, which appeared injured but quite mobile, and we watched it slowly ascend the huge birm the dam is built into over our breakfast time.
	</p>
	<p>
The surfaces were rough and there was a very strong, in excess of 25mph at times, headwind that slowed our roll and kicked up duststorms into our faces. The Centennial Mountian range in the distance was obscured by smoke, and our ride was largely down a straight, largely featureless, coverless corridor toward the approaching wilderness. We lunched in front of a property that had planted trees in a row by the road, which acted as a windblock, and soon turned left to follow the edge of the range. After cruising past Lakeview and checking out their cemeteryand catching views of some antelope, we closed the last few miles through the national wildlife refuge where no camping is allowed, and arrived just before dark at Red Rock Lake campground, where a number of other cyclists were camped.

	<p>
Just after dark, the temperature dropped sharply, the wind picked up, and it rained for much of the night and most of the next morning. I got super cold, and temperatures remained below 60F for the following several days. 
	</p>
</div> <!-- end of subentry -->


<div class="subentry">
	<h3>Red Rock Lake to Red Rock RV Park</h3>
	<p>
  The morning at Red Rock Lake was very cold, and the air smelled like a doused campfire; we later found out that a fire had been burning very close to our location at that time, and had likely been slowed by the rain. 
	</p>

	<p>
	It was a cold day, and we kept following along the base of the Centennial Range until it was time to climb Red Rock pass. We ascended once agian into mountians and suddenly the terrain went from open, largely sagebrush desert feeling stuff into an area reminiscent of the north woods of Wisconsin. Big trees, mushrooms, moss, friendly shade and cover agian. We had lunch on top of the pass, and began to roll down into Idaho. Finally. </p>
	<p>
	As we came near to Henry's Lake, it was getting dark, and we decided to camp at an RV park; Red Rock RV park. There were showers, cell reception, WiFi, indoor bathrooms; everything. It continued being cold and the sky issued a light pissing type rain for most of the night and morning.
	</p>

<div class="subentry">

	<h3>Red Rock RV Park to Island Park Lodge</h3>
	<p>
We had a slow, cold morning at Red Rock RV park. I finally ordered rain pants fro Gore Tex, given that my Army Surplus rain pants did not work for cycling in. not by any stretch, because they do not in fact stretch at all. When we finally rolled out, Rose and Patrick got very far ahead of Vlad and I, as is typical. Vlad noticed a turn off for a forest road on the route that I would have missed. It turned out that Rose and Patrick missed that turnoff completely.
</p>
<p>This section was for us, very cold, rainy, and muddy. There were beautiful creeks and land forms all around us, dense woods, and huge puddles that we had to dodge around. The riding was challenging and we both got completely soaked. When we finally arrived at Island Park/hwy 20, we went into the first building that appeared to be open to the public, which was a Subway/Adventure Motor Rentals/Outdoor type of store. An employee of the store invited us to sit down by the gas fireplace and dry our stuff. Eventually, along side a conversation with the employee, who let us stay by the fire well after the store closed, we got into contact with Rose and Patrick and all of us had a supper at the adjoining Subway. After a long discussion and calling around a bunch, we decided to pay for a night indoors at the Island Park Lodge just across the street from where we were.</p>
<p>
I tried making falafel in the microwave, which did not work to my satisfaction, and right  before I went to bed, I ventured outside barefoot to collect my bicycle to take it into the hotel room, and I banged the big toe on my right foot on one of the floor decking boards outside the lodge badly enough to take a big flap of skin off of my toe, and to bruise my foot overall so I was hobbled.
Rose helped me get patched up.
</p>

<div class="subentry">
	<h3>Island Park Lodge to Riverside Campground</h3>
	<p>
	We had breakfast at the cafe adjacent to the lodge and proceeded to roll down highway 20 buying every bottle of 'Yellow HEET' branded methanol along the whole of Island Park as we rode. We dodged one downpour in a gas station, and then ended up getting rained on a bit more as we were nearing the end of Island Park. Rose and I picked up 4 day fishing liscenes at the gas station we dodged the rain in, and we formulated a plan to get to a place we could concieveably fish: Riverside campground on the Snake River.</p>
	<p>


At Riverside campground, it continued to be rainy and cold. By our second night, we comandeered two campsites there: one to cook in and one to sleep in. The river was beautiful, the fishing was tough, its hard to fish such a large river with Tenkara rods.
	</p>
</div> <!-- end of subentry -->


<div class="subentry">
	<h3>Riverside Campgound to Warm River Campground</h3>
	<p>
We backtracked on the highway a little bit to the start of the Mesa Falls scenic byway. It was just that, quite scenic. Notably, we stopped at Mesa Falls for lunch, which involved a 700 some foot descent over about a mile. The falls are large, and a popular attraction.  
From there we biked back up the grade away from the falls area to a 'mostly downhill' route that ended at Warm River Campground.

	<p>
I'll now note that Riverside Campground was the first, but certianly not the last camp ground owned by 'Aud and Di' campground services, a private Utah company that runs many (possibly all?) National Forest campgrounds in the states of Idaho and Wyoming at least. (Some cursory info here: https://www.bendsource.com/bend/forests-for-sale-as-more-campgrounds-come-under-private-management-what-does-this-mean-for-campers/Content?oid=2137340 )
	</p>
	<p>
Warm River Campground also was operated by 'AuDi' Campground services, and these hosts were really looking at it. What appered to be a family gathering was camped next to us and using the pavillion. The temperatue finally climbed above 60F, and I commenced to spend some time fishing at it over the next few days. Our time at Warm River turned out to be extraordinarialy social, with fellow cyclists sharing our campsite on two out of the several days we stayed in that location.
One cyclist, Linda we had met prior in Helena at the post office. Another, Eddy was doing the divide, in his words 'as a bar crawl'.  Even a woman who was at the family gathering in the pavillion invited us over for a spaghetti dinner with fresh vegetables one evening.
	</p>
	<p>
The second day at warm river, Vlad and I rode into Ashton to recieve our food drop and replacemet backup tent with working zippers. After recieving our stuff and looking at phones, Vlad found out that he'd need to be in Milwaukee WI on 9/9/21. Thus began much corresondance and deliberation, and led to, several days later, Vlad and I taking off at 8pm from Ashton, ID down highway 20 to Rexburg, ID.

	<h3>The Rexburg Saga:</h3>
	<p>
On the way down US-20, we stopped at a gas station called: Maverick 'Adventure's First Stop'. Adventure indeed, we thought.
We closed the last few miles into Rexburg on a friendly paved rail trail, and headed for Eagle Park Campground. The campground is situated between the city sewage treatment plant and the local airport, so access is somewhat non-obvious. Some time after 11pm, we tried to enter through the Rexburg Nature Park. We found ourselves riding along the edge of the park, which had several singletrack mountian bike trails running through it, on one of the trails labeled 'more difficult', which had a chainlink fence on our left side, with the sewage plant ponds directly downhill, and a steep bank on our right side, which bottomed out 15 to 20 feet below into a gnarly swampy area strewn with logs and pools of standing water. Navigating our heavily loaded bikes on this track was akward and difficult to say the least, but we eventually found the campground.
	</p>

<div class="subentry">
	<h3>Orienting in Rexburg</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Meals at Restaurants in Rexburg are overwhelmingly large.</li>
		<li>There are a lot of infants and pregnant women in Rexburg.</li>
		<li>BYU Idaho bought up all of the liquor liscences in Rexburg.</li>
        </ul>
	<p>
	An internet search for nearby camping opportunities yielded, among a few options, a campground on the snake river called 'Beaver Dick'. We had to go. Beaver Dick was a somewhat cramped, short cut grass type of place. There was a nice hunting/sagegrass habitat area in the back that stretched for a long ways. I found a survival shelter while I was hiking at the next day.</p>

	<p>
	But this so called Beaver Dick campground was not very cool, so we rode several miles on to the other campground proximal to Rexburg. Warm Slough campground, a real life lazy river attraction where locals go to tube a section of the snake river and scream and party late into the night. The campsite we got was free, had great sightlines, and was full of trash.</p>
</div> <!-- end of subentry-->

<div class="subentry">
	<p>
	We went back to Rexburg, camped agian in Eagle Park, and then spent 2 nights in the Rexburg Super 8, then finally got out of Rexburg. Final note on Rexburg; if you are there, check out Richeous Slice Pizza.</p>
</div> <!-- end of subentry-->

<div class="subentry">
	<p>
We escaped Rexburg towards evening after clearing out of the Super 8, and made for Heisse, at the reccomendation of a bike shop employee. We encountered a restaurnat where we stopped for tater tots called 'Big Judds' home of something called the Man vs Food burger.
	</p>


	<p>
When we arrived at Heisse, we realized it was packed with lame commercial campgrounds with no cover and high cost. The hosts at one such campground informed us  of a free camping area at Wolf Flats. 
	</p>

	<p>
We proceeded to and through dusk down a rough dirt road and arrived at the BLM campground. Vlad played music for us, the albums Hexahedron by Ulver, and Cyperpunk by Billy Idol, and Live Session by 'Stop the Schitzo'.

In the morning while making breakfast, i heard a ruslting behind me, and out popped a moose. I stood and steadily backed up to the road, and waited for it to pass through the food campsite.

We studied the map and reaized that, even though we could see and hear highway 26 across the Snake River, there was no way to cross the river without backtracking. So, we loaded up and rode back the way we came, back past the commrecial campgrounds to cross the river agian, and get onto US-26. We stayed on that road for a very long time.
</p>
<p>
Near dusk we arrived in Swan Valley; where we immediately stopped at a groccery store moments before it closed and asked the staff where we should camp. Dispite the tip for free dispersed camping 'a handful of miles' out of town, we opted to pay for camping in the Sleepy Bear RV park right in town. Swan Valley has good vibes.

After Swan Valley, there was a lot of climbing to get up and over a large dam of the Snake River, behind which there is a reservoir that was/is at a critically low, disturbing-to-see water level. The views were spectacular, but the shoulder was narrow, and it seemed that that entire day we were going steeply either uphill or downhill, all interspersed with moderate to heavy traffic. It was a great relief to cruise into Alpine campground that evening, right near the border with Wyoming.
	</p>
	<p>
Our camp host at Alpine campground seemed to greatly enjoy zipping around the campground on her golf cart over and over agian, she was quite animated.

Very soon after leaving Alipine campground, we crossed the border to Wyoming and discovered a shop called 'Banannas', where you can get millitary surplus, fishing gear, ice cream, snacks, hunting gear, guns, smoking supplies including dabbing rigs, guns, handmade gifts and fireworks.
	</p>
	<p>
That evening, we finally reunited with our group. Dinner ran late and included squirrel stew and grouse. We camped at Cabin Creek Trailhead.

<div class="subentry">
	<h3>8/26–</h3>
	<p>
after our previous nights parting from RV we rode back past warm River campground and spent the night in a cozy spot in the national forest about a mile up the road. Come morning and breakfast Patrick realized he had forgotten his weather radio on the lawn of the post office in Ashton!  So back to Ashton we rolled…
	</p>
	<p>
Radio recovery success!!! It was in the lawn of the post office as Patrick had left it! So from here plans changed a bit…we will move onward to Jackson, off route, over a few days. 
	</p>

</div> <!-- end of subentry-->


<div class="subentry">
	<h3>8/27</h3>

	<p>
Leaving Ashton. We took the Ashton-Tetonia rail to trail and made it about 9 miles from Tetonia. Beautiful big trestles over a few rivers dotted our adventure down the trail and Coyotes sung us to sleep as the moon rose above the edge of the Tetons. 
	</p>

</div> <!-- end of subentry-->


<div class="subentry">
	<h3>8/28</h3>

	<p>
A quick roll in Tetonia provided us with a great little park to have breakfast in. Definitely recommend stopping there if touring in the area again. The park also has a great slide and swing set; fun!  We continued onward to Trail Creek campground, with a pit stop at Grand Teton brewing for a pint of Mocha Porter and to take a six pack with. Trail creek campground is another campground run by Audi…..$17/night and we got to have a real campfire and drink a few of the delicious mocha porters we were carrying. 
	</p>

</div> <!-- end of subentry-->


<div class="subentry">
	<h3>8/29</h3>

	<p>
Up and over the pass we go!! We left around noon and only took 3 hours to go 6 miles up with 10% grades! Lunch at the top of the pass with an amazing view of the Teton hole area. Then a beautiful looong drop down to Jackson we rolled on almost 100% paved bicycle trail. Jackson has many parks including on with public rock climbing walls and a free public gym! 
	</p>
</div> <!-- end of subentry-->



<div class="subentry">
	<h3>8/30</h3>

	<p>
A day of getting tasks done, buying groceries, and arranging food drop mail brought us to another night in Jackson. 
	</p>
</div> <!-- end of subentry-->



<div class="subentry">
	<h3>8/31</h3>

	<p>
Off to Cabin Creek area in a the National forest we rolled. Half paved bike path towards Hoback Junction, then hwy with a decent shoulder. Before our of Jackson we may have stopped at a horse gear store; we now own a rainbow lasso and a set of spurs….Hoback Junction surprisingly has a great grocery/liquor/has station with many good food choices. Rolling south from Hoback we found ~$3.75 in change, a securing strap, and …..  
	</p>

<div class="subentry">
	<h3>9/1</h3>

	<p>
Sleeping in, late brunch and an afternoon of going through gear and reassessing needs. A pair of hunters out for opening of bow-elk season spent the night near us and were out hunting this day, they didn’t get anything. 
	</p>
</div> <!-- end of subentry-->



<div class="subentry">
	<h3>9/2</h3>

	<p>
An early rise, Patrick wanted to go small game hunting, but upon wrapping breakfast up thunder was rolling and the rain started. We scuttled the 0.4 miles back to our tent to take cover….our tent seems still leak but at least the rest of the is more water proof after spraying it a few weeks ago. I think a new tent maybe I order as this one is getting old, well used, and needs some extra TLC to make it continue working well. In a rain lull we added our hammock rain fly over the tent…a solid solution for now. 
	</p>

	<p>
Grouse!!!! Thanks to another bow-elk hunter who got it on his way in and gave it to us for lunch. Yum! Sounds like RV should be here tomorrow? Hopefully…we miss their company. 
	</p>

</div> <!-- end of subentry-->

<div class="subentry">
	<h3>9/3</h3>

	<p>
We reunite!!!! Yay! So many stories to swap (a few we’ve shared with you) and lots of excitement brought us to a mighty chilly 0200 bedtime. We tucked ourselves in with frost covering our bikes and rain flies. We anticipate more of this to come as we spend the next two months moving closer to winter.

	<h3>to Jackson and beyond</h3>
	<p> We rode down highway 26 to Jackson, where we recieved a food drop, then proceeded to camp for free in an undisclosed location in the city.</p>
	<p> Jackson is a really messed up place. Things are too expensive because gentrification sorrounded by national forest. Even laundry is expensive. We camped agian in Jackson, in seperate parties due to bear/food considerations </p>

	<p> The stretch between Hoback campground and Warren Bridge campground was highway riding, but it was quite long. We made the mistake of not eating lunch, so ate a late supper in front of a very small 'C-Store' on top of the ridge we had to climb. 
A storm was brewing as night fell. We arrived at Warren Bridge (aka "no cover") campground and set up just in time for a huge, long lasting rain/wind storm to rock our campsite. A fair amount of water got into our tent thorugh seams whose seal was failing, and I became a human tent pole for a long portion of the night, holding up the tent as the wind threateaned to collapse it.
</p>
.
<p> That morning, Rose and Patrick left early to retrieve their new tent from the post office in Cora, WY. Vlad and I had skipped dinner due to the rain, so we slowly cooked and ate in the outhouse while we dried and packed our gear. Then made for Pinedale.</p>

<div class="subentry">
  <h3>Pinedale Vibes</h3>
  <p> Rose and Patrick rode on to Pinedale and encountered our friends from Lima: Belle, Luke, and Eric on the street. They all visited the Museum of the Mountian Man and hung out for the day. Vlad and I rode into town on a bike path that picked up a few miles out of town, and met them all at the camping area, a former KOA in the middle of the city that evening. </p>
  <p> Since we had sent a 2nd food drop to Cora, we had a few days to kill in Pinedale. We found being in Pinedale really comfortable. The parks have bathrooms with sinks that have hot and cold water; public power outlets are available. The food is good, a well stocked-groccery store and a few good restaurants abound. The local library is a palace.</p>
   <p> While in Pinedale, Rose and Patrick set up their new tent, the "Blacktail Hotel" with an enormous vestibule hangout area. Vlad and I ordered yet another new tent, one we hoped would be more stormworthy, the Alps Engineering Highlands 3. An enormous friggin tent that is bright lime green. Rose and Patrick noticed the Blacktail tent was drafty, and decided to return that tent and to buy an MSR tent at a local outdoor store, which also ended up being sent home, and being replaced by a 4 season tent that they also recieved in Pinedale.

   <p> We even took a brief vacation from Pinedale up to Freemont Lake campground, where we camped for 2 nights. On the first day there, Patrick finally saw a bear. Rose and I took the short ride to the CCC ponds just off of the bike path to fish, where Rose caught two rainbow trout for dinner that night. On the morning of the last day we were there, Vlad and I rode down to the Sandy Beach picnic and swimming area on Freemont lake where I stashed most of my gear under a camouflage tarp and rode up (about 2000 feet of climb) to Trails End campground. Vlad rode back into Pinedale to pick up our new tent. From Trail's End, I hiked into the Bridger Wilderness in search of potential fishing.`
   The creek was beautiful, but so tiny as to be very difficult to fish. Getting back onto the path from the creek involved some very steep climbing and bushwacking, but I did get out. The downhill was a lot of fun, and took longer than expected due to me having to repeatedly stop and admire the scenery over Freemont lake.

   <p> During our remaining time in Pinedale, we took in the Wind River Brew Fest, made a new friend, spent a day at the super fancy Pinedale Aquatic Center, including hot tub and waterslide, and generally got very good vibes. </p>

<div class="subentry">
	<h3>Boulder Lake and Sickness</h3>
	<p> We left Pinedale late and cruised down hwy 191 to the Wind River View RV Campground. Since our next food drop was for South Pass City, where the location is not open on Sunday, we had to use an extra day somewhere between the RV park and South Pass City. The next morning, we decided to use our extra day to bike the approximately 8 miles to Boulder Lake and camp on BLM land near Boulder Creek to fish. Both the fishing store and outdoor store in Pinedale said that the place to fish is Boulder creek, which is dam-regulated and has a decent water level, unlike many of the nearby streams, which have experienced low water levels and lots of "summer kill".

	Camping at Boulder creek was free and almost ideal, except that our campsite was over a fifth of a mile from the outhouse. The stream was beautiful, with huge boulders interspersed. I had a lot of fun hopping and climbing on the boulders. That night, Vlad was extremely feverish, and needed help to walk from the tent to the picnic area. For the next few days, Vlad was largely unable to move or eat very much. We camped at Boulder creek for a total of three nights. Rose and I fished and had quite a sporting time of it, but were unable to catch any dinner. 
	</p>
	<p>
	After several days of camping out, Vlad finally felt ready to bike out of Boulder lake area back to the RV park. Rose took off early to hit up Pinedale for food. Two more nights in the RV park for Vlad to recover, and we're finally ready to roll out. Onto the BASIN!!
