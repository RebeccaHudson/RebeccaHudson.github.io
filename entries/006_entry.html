	<h3>Entry 6: Remote Vistas</h3>
<p>
Yesterday, we finally got out of the Pinedale vicinity. Vlad was feeling well enough to ride, so we booked out of the Wind River View RV park around 3:30PM, and headed down the highway toward the Roscoe hayfield. A solid, almost 20 mile ride into an area with very few services until Rawlins. The high for the day was 50 degrees. Pretty chilly. I rolled out a tiny bit early to mail a skull home at ht post office in Boulder, and met the party at a nearby gas statin where we obtained snacks and Methanol. We rode through the desert in the chill, aiming for the ACA-marked Roscoe hayfield with camping, but ended up very close to that, but right on the highway.

I'm currently writing this morning in the tent from that cutout. Today, we are due for some climbing.
