<h2>Entry 3: Looking at Living Life in Lima</h2>

<div class="subenty">
<h3>Seeley Lake to Ovando</h3>
<p> An easy enough ride with cooler weather and easy going roads.
  All four of us crammed into the 'Hoosgow' novelty jailhouse in Ovando. We were evidently the first cyclists to camp in Ovando since the grizzly incident earlier in the month.  We were told that all other divide riders either bypassed Ovando or stayed in the motel. </p>
</div>


<div class="subentry">
<h3> Ovando to Not Big Nelson</h3>
<p>
  An Adventure Cycling tour group with a SAG wagon turned us away from camping at the Big Nelson campground; so we biked back to the route and camped just inside of the boundary of the Helena national forest at the beginning of the climb to Huckleberry Pass. 
First night where we had to hang our bear bags 10 feet up in the air, inbetween two trees, at least 4 feet away from each tree.
It took a while to realize (thanks, Vlad) that it's easier to hoist up the load split three ways, on three cords rather than all at once.
</p>
</div>


<div class="subentry">
<h3>Not Big Nelson to Lincoln</h3>
<p>
We rode up to huckleberry pass. There were delicious huckleberries.
A storm kicked up as we were descending, which resulted in the party being seperated for a while.
</p>

<p>
Rose and Patrick camped at Spring Creek campground.
They were visited by cats, several deer, including two 8-point bucks in velvet, a 'grandma deer' doe, and a family of ducks swimming on the creek.
</p>


<p>
Vlad and I camped at Hooper Park on the east side of Lincoln.

The camp host (a clear Tree Nut) asked us if we had been to Seeley Lakem and then asked us if we
had met Gus, we said that we had, in fact, met Gus. He pointed out what he
described as the second oldest Ponderosa pine in the stand of trees around the
campground. Accoding to him, after 250 to 300 years, the bark of the Ponderosa
goes from reddish and rough to a puzzle-piece kind of appearance. The other
distinguishing characteristic, we learned, is that the needles of Ponderosa
pine are longer than the needles of any other pine in North America.
</p>
</div>

<div class="subentry">
<h3>Lincoln to Alpaca Ranch</h3>
  Tent camping first night, then a rest day sleeping in the famous alpaca ranch cabin that night. Made pancakes for other riders that morning.
</div>


<div class="subentry">
<h3>'Lower Llama to Upper Dog 'Alpaca Ranch to Teepee by Dog Creek</h3>
<p>We stood right before the turn to cross dog creek, discussing the teepee that was in front of us behind a gate marked Private Property, and an old couple started approaching from the distance. They introduced themselves as Carol and Cliff, and invited us to stay on their property. Not just on their property, but in the teepee that we saw that they said their daughter had put up that same day. Dog creek ran right by the teepee, we were able to hang food on an archway for an old driveway the property ownwers were not using.</p>
</div>


<div class="subentry">
<h3>Teepee by Dog Creek</h3>
<p>Climbing up Priest Pass then to Helena
  Mountian Bike City!
</p>
</div>


<div class="subentry">
<h3>Rest Day in Helena</h3>
<p>
  Got free-range yard-chicken eggs for breakfast. MTB city also features a flock of ducks, two dogs, a flock of young turkeys, and one cat.
  Biked into downtown into Garage Cyclerey where all 4 of us recieved a bicycle safety check.
  Vlad, whose chainring was missing 4 teeth as of the alpaca ranch, was able to get a new chainring even though they were out of stock, because a shop employee who used to ride ECRs had an extra chainring sitting around, and was willing to sell Vlad the chainring.
Conrad at MTB city is quite the host, and shared some interesting stories wth us. As well as a couple of full plastic cups of locally made bourbon.
</p>

<h3>Second rest day in Helena.</h3>
<p>Generally resulting from a postal SNAFU, we ended up here for a second rest-day. The smoke is bearing down as I write this; we are hidden out at 'The Hub' coffee in downtown Helena.
 The mountains and sky aruond the city are shrouded in gray wildfire smoke, the heat is stifling, the air is choking. We have been shuffling from one indoor space to another, hoping to wait out some of the hours of worst air quality.  </p>
<p> We are scoping out routes that use more highway and less technical rock terrain in the interest of getting out of the most intense smoke areas. </p>
</div>


<div class="subentry">
<h3>Helena to Boulder Bicycle Barn</h3>
<p>Climbed what a local later referred to as 'Boulder Hill' on the I-15, from which we descended into Boulder MT.
Boulder MT is clearly haunted. There is a highly conspicuous kid prison near the fairgrounds. Nobody answered the phone when we called the posted number for staying at the bicycle barn.</p>
</div>


<div class="subentry">
<h3>Boulder Bicycle Barn to I-25/Sketchy Tunnel</h3>
<p>We took off from Boulder Bicycle Barn, and rode on backroads near (but not on) I-15 into a channel between two rock walls, which lead to a tunnel which was built in 1911. The tunnel was closed... We camped at a dispersed campsite just south of the tunnel next to a creek, and within eyeshot of the innerstate.
</p>
</div>
 

<div class="subentry">
<h3>Sketchy Tunnel to Butte to Thomphson Park</h3>
<p>
  Rose and I rode somewhat early out of camp and over a brief but steep climb to join a frontage road, then the I-25 for a dramatic, very-fast descent into Butte.  In Butte, we collected the speaker I'd ordered, checked out the outdoors store, visited the Bad Beaver bike shop, and ate a lot of food at Pita Pit. Also at Pita Pit, a fellow cyclist stopped to check out our rigs, and Vlad somehow identified and befriended a fellow math person.
We hauled on up to Thompson park, where we went to setup camp, and were approached by a forest service person, who told us that we could not camp there, but if we left and rode up the road and took the next right, we'd reach a place where nobody would bother us. We packed up tents, ate dinner in the dark, and rode up the road to set up agian.
</p>
</div>


<div class="subentry">
<h3> Thompson Park to Linda and Dave's Place</h3>
<p>
  We rolled out the next morning and commenced to climb for a few miles, which took us under a huge rail trestle the park is known for. We were still within the boundary of Thompson park when we selected a cutout on the side of the road to eat lunch at.  As we were eating lunch, a white pickup truck (a very common sight out here) rolled up, and a man wearing a bicycle jersey stepped out and pulled a road bike out of the bed of his truck. He approached us and asked us what was up and invited us to stay at his property which was just up the road, which he described as 'XXX (number redacted) with the red roof'. He then took off down the grade on his fast-looking road bike and our group decided tha we should at least look at it before turning down free lodging.
We rode sub-1-mile distance to his place and negotiated the quarter mile loose gravel driveway to a stunning property with mountian views, big boulders, and a thoughtfully managed woodland. After looking at it and doing a vibe check, we decided that we should just spend the night there. When Dave arrived back he showed us around, and we were fed a chichen dinner, given cigars, a sauna, indoor lodging in a guest cabin above the garage, and had the opportunity to share some scotch and tequila with our hosts. That night it finally rained enough to wet the ground. We were fed breakfast and Patrick sighted a moose on the property in the morning. 
</p>
</div>


<div class="subentry">
<h3>Linda and Dave's Place to Big Hole River Access</h3>
<p> Dewey and Big Hole 'Powerhouse' fishing access.
  The campgrounds near Dewey were all closed, when we rolled up to one that had been taken over by forest service fire crew and asked about camping, they directed us to the Powerhouse river access on the Big Hole river and assured us that all of the rules prohibiting camping were suspended, and that nobody would stop us from camping. We pitched tents on the gravel parking lot right next to the vault toilet.
</p>
</div>


<div class="subentry">
<h3>Big Hole River Access to Wise River and Pettengil Campground</h3>
<p>
In Wise River at the restaurant, we found out that we'd need to wait a few days for our packages to arrive in Polaris..
And thus begins a slow roll down the Pioneer Mountians scenic byway.
</p>
</div>


<div class="subentry">
<h3>Pettengil Campground to Little John Campground</h3>
<p>The offcial campground was overrun with people. We camped off an entrance a bit away from the sign, with creek access and steep enough terrain to keep most of the cars out.</p>
</div>


<div class="subentry">
<h3>Little John Campground to Crystal Park, Elkhorn hot Springs, and Grasshopper Campground</h3>
<p>
  Camped with a fellow rider for one night. It rained for most of the night. 
For the first time in this trip, we pitched 2 hammock rainflies next to each other to use as a shelter for cooking.
</p>
</div>


<div class="subentry">
<h3> Grasshopper Campground to Bannack State Park </h3>
<p>
We arrived in Polaris after a downhill ride and stop at the famous Ma Barnes country store, to find that 3 of the four  boxes of our food had arrived. Cherri the postal worker helped Rose and Patrick redirect their missing primary food box to Lima, and gave Rose a ride back to Ma Barnes to stock up on a few more items to get us down the road to Lima.
This was the day that We finally popped off of the scenic byway into a high, dry, sagebrush desert.
</p>
</div>


<div class="subentry">
<h3>Bannack State Park to Medicine Lodge Creek</h3>
<p>The old ghost town was jammed with RVs for the weekend. We camped in a teepee in the RV campground.
  I caught a fish that I was unable to identify in the creek at Bannack in the sagebrush on Grasshopper creek behind our teepee.
</p>
</div>


<div class="subentry">
<h3>Medicine Lodge Creek to Big Sheep Creek/Caboose Canyon</h3>
<p>
Biking upwind, uphill, on a loose surface is hard.
I found a skull at the oasis where Rose and Patrick were waiting for Vlad and I.
We camped in a nice canyon. Super scenic.
</p>
</div>



<div class="subentry">
<h3>Caboose Canyon/Big Sheep Creek to Lima</h3>
<p>
Rest day at canyon. Took time to catch up on sewing repairs to clothing.
Utilized an incredible swimming hole in Big Sheep Creek.
</p>
</div>


<div class="subentry">
<h3>Lima</h3>
  <p>
  Our boxes were not here when we arrived on Tuesday.
  We are getting to know Lima extremely well.
  We've visited the I-15 rest stop, the historic cemetery, etc.
  The first 2 nights here were spent at the Mountian View RV park, then we camped at the gazebo in front of the gas station, which unlike tbe RV park, is free to camp in and provides at least some shade.
  Over the weekend we dipped into the Beaverhead Deerlodge National Forest for a break from gas station gazebo life until our box arrives tomorrow (Monday).

Entry 2: Live from Seeley Lake MT!
<div class="editorsnote">
  <pre>Pictures added as of 7/18/21. See the end of this entry for pictures..</pre>
</div>
<div class="subentry"> <!-- divide into more subentries -->
<p> Catching up on our current situation:</p>
<h2>ROSE:</h2>
<h3>Rooseville to Eureka!</h3>
<p>
An early rise for a 10 mile trek up hwy 93 to Whitefish Bike retreat for our shuttle up to Rooseville, MT at the Canadian boarder. We ended up giving our shuttle driver, James, a van conversation to add to his top five strangest conversations he’s everhad; you’ll have to catch a ride with him to find out what it was about. 
A few hours of putting racks back on, finishing a few beers, and getting gear situated before a leisurely ride to Eureka MT.
</p>

<p>
Eureka, MT has a cute space next to the creek for camping right in town, though the bathrooms are at the 24 hr gas station across the street AND beware the 0700 sprinkler system. The historical site has a nice pavilion with water and electricity near the city “wild walk” along the creek, don’t try to camp in the pavilion…also beware of the skunk.
</p>
</div><!-- end subentry-->

<div class="subentry">
<h3>Eureka, MT to Whitefish, MT</h3>

<p>
About 20 miles from Eureka to Clarence Creek campground, a simple mountain two site camping area near a beautiful small creek with ice cold delicious (filtered) water.  We are still getting organized and filtering through what we really need/want at this point (Rebecca and Patrick already mailed a few things back home in Whitefish—I feel I’ll be doing the same once back in Whitefish).
</p>

<p>
About 12 miles from Clarence Creek to Tuchuck campground. 
This was and adventure within one for sure.  I(R ose) had a non-repairable side wall blowout on my rear wheel about 3 miles from Tuchack campground. Rebecca and Patrick returned to my rescue after about a mile of hike-biking. Upon our arrival to Tuchuck we met Doug who immediately offered tools, supplies and a ride the next day. After some discussion and planning we (Rose and Patrick) had arranged a ride back to Whitefish with Doug; Rebecca and Vlad planned on carrying on following the route back to Whitefish.
</p>


<h4>The Rose &#38; Patrick show:</h4>

<p>
The ride with Doug was wonderful.  He is local Montanan with a heart of gold and a wonderful knowledge of the area we were in. Patirick and I both felt like we got a tour of the area with history and defining land formations identified.  We ended up taking most of the route we would have riden via truck; Red Meadow lake is beautiful and I wish we could have stayed there for the night.  We rolled into Whitefish about 4.5 hours after pickup from Doug and he so kindly brought us to the bike shops (all closed for Sunday) and an outdoor store looking for a new tire, with no luck on that front.
</p>


<p>
The next day Patrick was able to take my wheel and get a new tire (as well as a spare that would fit all out wheels) from Glacier Cyclery &#38; Nordic! Thank you all at that location, you ended up helping us out three separate times!!  
Vlad and Rebecca rolled into camp this evening. 
</p>

<p>
Tuesday, JUNE 29th-(WONDER WOMAN)- EMILY ARRIVES!!!! YAY!!  
In an attempt to surprise Emily, Patrick and I rolled into Whitefish early and got coffee and toast (and free makeup samples cause they were out if a second slice of sourdough?!?!?) The train was 2 hours late....
Breakfast with all five of us in Whitefish!  A rest and bike mechanic stuff day...Riding again tomorrow.
</p>

<div class="subentry">
<h3>Vlad thoughts: </h3>
<p>
I'm finally in Montanta, USA! Some of our readers are perhaps aware of Montana, Bulgaria, which I guess I should visit next to compare. For the record, North Dakota is very flat, whereas Montana is hilly, mountainous, and dry (the dry heat is quite reminiscent of Bulgarian summers I grew up with). 
</p>

<p>
After the two day drive to Whitefish (June 21 and 22), we noticed my front disc break seemed to whistle, so the following rest day (June 23), I left Duncan at Glacier Cyclery for adjustments (which would not be the last time); also from Glacier Cyclery I procured the all-important fanny pack for Rebecca, and a strap for the speaker Rose &#38; Patrick lent me (music regulates the pedal cadence, especially uphill).
Notably, Whitefish is home to Proof Research, a corporation developing carbon-fiber barrels and rifles, a far cry from the pure math research I assumed they'd be doing.
</p>

<p>
The following day (Thursday, June 24) we set off (way early, trying to leave by 7am) on our bikes toward the Whitefish Bike resort, wherein we had some local ice-cream to prepare us.
Next, we were shuttled to Roosville, MT, around 1,000 feet from the U.S.-Canadian border (on the U.S. side), and after some adjustments and repacking (Rebecca and I had to dismantle the front racks off Loreli and Duncan in order to fit them on the shuttle's bike bracket), we finally began riding the Great Divide Mountain Bike Route! 
There was a spittle of rain that prompted me to don my rain jacket for a while, but otherwise we had smooth mostly flat and downhill ride punctuated with a few climbs and quite the breathtaking views (Montana is Big Sky country after all). 
We finished what we consider Day 0's riding at Eureka, MT (we found it!).
Therein Rebecca and I had local pizza for dinner, then attempted and promptly aborted a journey along the riverwalk due to an overabundance of mosquitoes. Note: the sun sets after 9:30pm here and it is light quite past 10pm, so twilight is much later than usual.
</p>

<p>
June 25, Day 1 of riding, was begun with a massive breakfast at the local Cafe Jax, followed by a short steep ascent, continued with an uneventful, chiefly downhill ride on paved roads for the first half of the day, then a not too difficult uphill to our first proper (i.e. away from people and amenities) campsite at Clarence Creek. 
Day 2 of riding took us down, and then up to our first crossing of the continental divide -- Whitefish Divide. 
The climb was hard: steep over a dirt road littered with rocks, quite a lot of which I had to push rather than ride Duncan over, but eventually we made it, and at the very top there was even snow! 
Note: we're doing this in an unprecedented heat wave with temperatures in the 90s (Fahreneheit), but fortunately the virtually inexistent humidity, the tree cover, our downhill velocity, cooling arm-sleeves (bonus UV protection!) and coming from Madison's near 100% humidity made the high temperatures actually pleasant (though our carrying gallons of water was indeed justified).
Post-Divide we descended to Tuchuck, but did not all of us continue to Red Meadow as planned due to Rose's sidewall blowout (treacherous sharp rocks!)
</p>
</div> <!-- end of Vlad subentry -->


<div class="subentry">
<h4>The Rebecca and Vlad show:</h4>

<p>
The RV team rides from Tuchuck to Red Meadow Lake. We encounter hot conditions, and a steep climb up to Red Meadow pass (more bike pushing from V), punctuated by our first black bear sighting (it ran away; that's why we blare music as we ride: to ensrure bear awareness of us: don't want to startle a sleeping bear!).
</p>
<p>
At Red Meadow lake, Rebecca and Vlad camp at the free National Forest campground, get chased around by bugs (from mosquitos really, the bees did not bite), and have a 4:00pm takeoff the following afternoon after Rebecca installs front brake pads and re-adjusts the front rack on Loreli. 
We then descend steeply and terrifyingly until Rebecaa's front rack jostles loose (faulty bolt) and Vladimir's back break seems to fail. 
</p>
<p>
We then spent an hour and a half replacing the break pad with a sturdy one, and continue a very speedy descend until we reach the forest road. We see another black bear, then go somewhat fast on the forest road, which is for a while a gravel road with lots of fun ups and downs, requiring very careful and focused riding, but we make it finally to the paved road around Whitefish lake, which we follow succesfully and without incident to the campground at Whitefish, thereby completing a loop and rejoining our friends.
</p>
<p>
The following day, June 29th, is a rest day, during which I (Vlad) once again deposit Duncan with Glacier Cyclery to double-check my rear-break work and fix the housing of my front break cable. More replacement break pads are procured, and amazing crepes are had.
</p>

<h3>Swan River to HWY 83/Seeley Lake   AND Swan River to Clearwater Lake</h3>
<h4>A.  Rose and Patrick</h4>
<p>
     Well.....we had a ride arranged for noon then the lady came by and the truck she was going to use was not available anymore.  Not even a half hour later we had a local gentleman stop and offer assitance and "someone will be back in half hout to hour"- 45 Minutes later Ally, her elderly Mom, and Lily- the 4 month old pug rolled up to give us a ride to Seeley Lake, MT.  About 45 minutes later we rolled into Big Larch Campground and eventually found the bicycle camping.  Thank you trail angels that have helped us out so far!! We keep you all in our hearts and can only hope to someday pay it forward!
</p>

<h4>B. Emily Rebecca Vlad</h4>
<p>
We set off in the cool of the morning for Clearwater lake where Patrick said there were great views and camping along the lake. Early in the day's ride, a highly annuated man with red hat on an E Fat Bike crossed paths with us and explained that he should head home for the day, so he turned around and followed us frmo explained that Sycamore Tree is not an actual tree but is a Catholic resort.  
    <ul>
    <li>goat yelling 'DEATH'...</li>
    <li>climbed past holland lake, very busy. Many boat folks. 2 identical white Prisuses formed a mini traffic jam on a dirt forest road..</li>
    <li>Dirt road with  bear tracks</li>
    <li>Tiny singletrack felt like we were totally lost.</li>
    <li>had to portage bicycles over a downed tree, only to reload and portage over what our directions
    apparently described as 'ascend up a steep hill' and should have described as 'push bike up barely
    passable not-quite-even-singletrack' which had us worried we were lost unitl we came upon the next
    direction onto a forest road.</li>
    <li>My rear brake completely failed almost exactly at the clearwater lake trailhead, and I had to hike down a steep hiking path fully loaded with one working break...</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h3>Camp + Rest Day at clearwater lake.</h3>
<p>Long hike down; only visible campsite occupied by family. When approached, they let us know that other campsites were available on the hiking trail along the lake shore.  Very soon after setting up camp, I(R) waded naked into Clearwater lake up to my ribcage, and in short order caught and released two very small fish.
 </p>

 <h4>rest day:<h4>
 <ul>
	 <li>solo stove bread success (the breakthrough)  VLAD.</li>
	 <li> Rebecca changed break pads on rear of Loreli and and readjusts rear brake</li>
		 <li>Finally re-leveled my front rack, which had been off kilter since the descent from Red Meadow Lake, replaced the defective lock nut on the front rack and added missing washers and threalocker... and re-wrapped my bar tape so it doesnt's straigh up fall off as I ride.</li>
		 <li>that evening we hiked 80% of our gear up to the parking lot at clearwater (a steep and at least 1/2 mile walk). </li>
 </ul>

 <h3>  Biking DAY!! to seeley lake.</h3>
 <p> We got up at 530AM, packed tents and sleeping gear, and hiked up to the top. We ate breakfast and were on our way by 8. </p>
 <ul>
	 <li>    climbed up the pass and rebecca's rear brake failed again because I didn't tension the bolt holding 
		 the cable enough.</li>
	 <li> Singletrack at the top with tall grass on both sides. </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
 We traverse the SLIDE ZONE, described on our official maps as a place to exercise great caution as the trail has failed there before previously. In a few instances, wrecking one of our bicycles would have entailed a drop off of a steep cliff and essentially instant death or serious injury. At the end of the nerve-wracking single track, where the forest road picked up, we had a pre-prepared container lunch.</p>
 <p>
 <ul>
	 <li>   MTB Descent into seeley.
		 Early on in the descent, friendly people riding up the grade apporach (rebecca and louie), flag us down for a moment,  and say that rose and 'Scott' pat are at a place called "Big Larch". </li>
	 <li>We roll into Big Larch National Forest Campground.</li>
	 <li>So its... Vacation from vacation. in seeley lake and getting comfortable for a minute.</li>
	 <li>Ovando incident!!! OMG. (external link)</li>
	 <li>the librarian Susan is friendly, lends out Travels With Charlie by Steinbek for Patrick on my honor.</li>
	 <li>so, no missolua spur, but 2 drops in Seeley Lake anyway, WTF.</li>
	 <li>A common occurance at the Big Larch campground is spotting a black bear on the beach, within eyeshot of our bicycle campsites in the morning or evening.</li>
	 <li>Fat Hippie in Seeley Lake is a cool headshop, they are among the most prominent retailers in town.</li>

	 <li>Austin and Frida show up to transport Emily and Cyclesauraus home!  Bike tour style margaritas make the night special!!</li>
	 <li> When I(R) went to fish just out of town, I encountered a mennonite farmers market in the Baptist church parking lot.</li>
	 <li>Rebecca loses sunglassses, likely stolen by a raven, which we know have a special interest in shiny objects.</li>
	 <li>Doing laundry, visiting Gus, the biggest larch in North America, and looped the lake with Rosie.</li>
	 <li>The bear that killed the lady in Ovando was found and shot.</li>

<h3>Post from Eureka (written by RH) </h3>
<p>
We made it. The van has been returned, our gear packed and repacked several times, a rest day taken in Whitefish, the shuttle boarded on time, and disembarked from. We're now in Eureka. I have even figured out how to post to this blog with git, and how to use the GoPro camera. No more deadlines.

<h3>Text from in van, 6/22/2021</h3>
<p>
We are on highway 2, and I have vi opened up on my Toughbook; I'm editing a brand new, blank file.  
Just entered into Shelby Montana, en-route to Glacier National Park, mountains occasionally looming in the distance.
We have been in this rental van for what feels like a lifetime, but in fact, it's only been since 11AM yesterday that we  
have been in here. There was initially an intention to camp on the eastern edge of Montana, but time did not allow for it,
so, we have been driving through the day, the night, then the day agian.  

We are running up against exactly one hard deadline after the van is due tonight at 11PM in Columbia Falls, MT. 
The shuttle from Whitefish, MT to Roosvile, MT, where we are officially beginning the route.  
Some shuffing of gear is in order, as well as exactly two nights of camping to recover from being in transit.      
I still have to figure out what the template for this blog will be ( is a template even in order for such a thing? ).
A lot is up in the air, but I feel that at least I am ready for action.
