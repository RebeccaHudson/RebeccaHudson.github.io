    <p> Græn R∞m is a public living room for utopian (re)creation. Guests are invited to read, rest, play, and socialize in a cozy, communal environment. </p>
 <p>
 The project takes its name from three different concepts of ‘the green room.’
  <!-- ol>
    <li> In theater, music, and entertainment: a space to relax and socialize backstage; a room for artists and guests to prepare before, and retire after, a performance. </li>
    <li>In the White House: an artfully decorated state parlor used for intimate receptions and tea ceremonies.</li>
    <li>In surfing parlance: the sublime yet precarious space inside the barrel of a breaking wave.</li>
    </ol--!>
